# Image Processing

## Problem Statement

The project helps you learn how different image-processing methods affect an image.

## Approach

The project uses different operations with images such as point operations, histogram enhancement, neighborhood operations, geometric transformations, and creative effects. 

## Results

Soem of the results were:
Brighter, darker, high-contrast, and low-contrast versions of the image.
Transformed images such as rotated, scaled, etc.
Creative image effects using combinations of methods.

## Key Findings

Some of the findings were:
Low-contrast images have narrow histograms; equalization spreads intensities.
Order of operations matters for creative filters.
Basic image processing is the foundation of modern AI image tools.

## Technologies

I used these technologies in the lab:
Python
NumPy
Matplotlib
OpenCV 
Google Colab

## How to run

Follow the instructions provided by teacher:
Google Colab.
Upload the notebook.
Upload the input image used in the lab.
Run the cells in order.
