# Rodrigo-Sierra-Computer-Vision-Portfolio

This repository is for storing the documentation for my ITAI1378 Computer Vision class.

This course covered computer vision from basic image processing to advanced AI techniques for tasks like object recognition and scene analysis. I learned the fundamentals of image processing and advanced AI techniques which allow me to understand visual recognition, deep learning, and Visual Language Models (VLMs).

The practical exercises allowed me to learn standard libraries and frameworks yo apply computer vision in real world scenarios.

I bring strong skills in team management, problem-solving, leadership, customer focus, and communication, complemented by foundational AI knowledge and hands on practice. This combination allows me to understand and contribute to technology initiatives while leveraging my extensive expertise in enterprise systems and process optimization.

The competencies I acquired through this class serve as a solid foundation for future projects or jobs, enabling me to further explore and integrate these concepts with other fields like Robotics. It will allow me to develop skills and new applied knowledge in several fields which will be like a tool box to participate in new challenges.
